In the wild world of web development, making your users happy is the golden rule. So, let's talk about something simple yet seriously effective: "just show a spinner."

Imagine you're clicking buttons or loading stuff on a webpage—those moments when you're left hanging. That's where spinners come in. They might sound like no big deal, but they're like the unsung heroes of a smooth user experience.

Now, there's this fancy concept called optimistic updates (you might've heard of it in React Query or SvelteKit). It promises seamless actions, but here's the catch—it can get real messy. Handling optimistic updates means dealing with a ton of complicated logic, making your code a headache. Bugs might sneak in, and you'll spend more time fixing issues than enjoying your coding adventure.

That's where the beauty of "just show a spinner" shines through. It's all about keeping things simple and clear. When users do something on your site, throw in a spinner right away. It's like a little nod to say, "Hey, I'm on it!" No need for fancy tricks, just a good ol' loading spinner.

Why keep it simple? Because simplicity rocks, especially in user experience. Users love knowing what's happening, and a spinner does just that. It tells them, "Hold on, I'm working on your request." No need to complicate things or keep users guessing.

And let's be real—if something takes forever to load, there might be a snag somewhere. Your users, armed with the knowledge of the spinner, can be patient or reach out for help if needed.

To sum it up, forget the fancy stuff—stick to spinners. They might seem basic, but trust me, they're the secret sauce to a happier user and a less stressed-out developer. So, let those spinners spin and make your web experience smoother, one click at a time!
